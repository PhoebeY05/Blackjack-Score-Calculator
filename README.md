## Disclaimers
- Styling optimised for iPhone 15 Plus
### Might improve in future:
- Redundant code as I chose to copy some elements instead of render items conditionally in view of time (e.g. Customise Screen is mostly a copy of Score Screen)
- Repeated functionalities to bypass the constraints of the use cases (e.g. returnUpdated & updateElement)
- Case-specific components that can be generalised (e.g. all the Popups in Popup.js)

## What does this app do?
1. Calculates scores based on each player's combo

- Standard: Preset rotation and fixed or variable duration
